## Status

Project is _expansionable_.

That means it is finished and I like how it works. But I am open to any issues connected to it (such as bug fix or adding new features in the long long future).

Additionally because this is my site I have an eye on it and it will be constantly developed.

## Why did I create it

I wanted two things: learn ASP .NET and have my website. So I connected them and this is it.
